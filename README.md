# FileLock
The File Lock software is a light weight portable locker that protects your privacy by helping you encrypt files of any format on your desktop system. The software uses highly secured encryption algorithm to encrypt the files you have chosen. There are no restrictions placed on the type of files you can encrypt making it highly useful software of choice. The most advanced feature of the software is that it lets you port the encrypted files to other computer that can be opened only by using your authenticate password on that computer.  File Lock software has a very rich, responsive, easy-to-use, and clutter-free interface. You can add files just by clicking on the add icon and can add any number of files on the fly. The software encrypts the selected files and a database is maintained to keep track of the encrypted files so the user is kept informed about the encrypted files on his computer. When an encrypted file is opened it decrypts on entering the authenticate password and the file plays its respective role (for example: a video file opens and plays the media, a MS-Word file shows its contents, etc.). When the decrypted file is closed after the user is finished performing operations it encrypts back into the encrypted file format. This feature allows the files to be always safe and secure no matter in which computer it is present.
